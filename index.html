            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I'm currently in the final year of my Software Engineering degree at McGill University completing minor in Applied Artificial Intelligence. You'll find me where at the cross-roads of tech and real-world impact. Currently, I'm revolutionizing the cancer therapy development pipeline with unsupervised learning, completing my capstone research at Mila and the NIH.</p>
            <p>My fascination lies at the intersection of AI and strategic planning. Here, I see AI as a powerful ally for businesses, transforming insights into action and supercharging products. My goal is to demystify AI for the business world, showing how it can be a catalyst for innovative design and strategic decision-making. It’s not just about algorithms and data; it’s about harnessing this technology to drive meaningful change in how businesses operate and compete.</p>
            <p>Community is my anchor. My roots in Toronto saw me getting my hands dirty (quite literally) at the Evergreen Brickworks Children’s Garden. That early experience shaped my approach to leadership and teamwork. Fast forward to now, I’m juggling many hats at the McGill Engineering Undergraduate Society, overseeing 6-figure budgets and leading dynamic teams. As President of the McGill Product Management Association, I focus on delivering enriching experiences for over 500 of our members, fostering real connections and teaching technical skills. Chairing the TechFair committee was another highlight, bringing together 175+ engineering firms and 2500+ engineering students at the faculty's largest job fairs, paving the way for unparalleled career-building opportunities.</p>
            <p>When I’m not geeking out over AI or rallying the troops at McGill, you’ll catch me carving the slopes on my skis, jet-setting to the next adventure, or swapping stories with just about anyone willing to share their unique life playlist. Life’s a journey with many paths, and I’m here for all the twists and turns!</p>



            <h2>Current Interests</h2>
            <p>Curing cancer @ Mila. Completing my capstone research project in Professor Paul François' lab. Investigating how unsupervised learning can be used to quantify reactions elicited by proteins in T-cells.</p>
            <p>Lifelong Learning. Continous learning in areas of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.</p>
            <p>Becoming an AI consultant. Learning about enterprise applications of AI solutions, C-suite level go-to-market stragies for LLMs.</p>
            <p>Going to the Olympics (maybe by 2050). Getting my skiing skills up to competition level.</p>
