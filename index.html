            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I'm currently in the final year of my Software Engineering degree at McGill University completing minor in Applied Artificial Intelligence. You'll find me where at the cross-roads of tech and real-world impact. Currently, I'm revolutionizing the cancer therapy development pipeline with unsupervised learning, completing my capstone research at Mila and the NIH.</p>
            <p>Community is my anchor. My roots in Toronto saw me getting my hands dirty (quite literally) volunteering at the Evergreen Brickworks Children’s Garden, that I had gone to every weekend growing up. That early experience shaped my approach to leadership and teamwork. </p>
            <p>Fast forward to today, I’m juggling many hats at the McGill Engineering Undergraduate Society. As President of the McGill Product Management Association, I focus on delivering enriching experiences for our members. Chairing the TechFair committee was another highlight, bringing together engineering firms and our students at the faculty's largest career fairs, and months later hearing my friends tell me about the jobs they secured.</p>
            <p>When I’m not commiting code or rallying the troops at McGill, you’ll catch me carving up the slopes on my skis, listening to the latest Drake release, or hosting the best parties in the city.</p>



            <h2>Current Interests</h2>
            <p>Curing cancer @ Mila. Completing my capstone research project in Professor Paul François' lab. Investigating how unsupervised learning can be used to quantify reactions elicited by proteins in T-cells.</p>
            <p>Lifelong Learning. Continous learning in areas of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.</p>
            <p>Becoming an AI consultant. Learning about enterprise applications of AI solutions, C-suite level go-to-market stragies for LLMs.</p>
            <p>Going to the Olympics (maybe by 2050). Getting my skiing skills up to competition level.</p>
